# What is Infrastructure as a Code?
Infrastructure as a Code (IaC) is an approch to manage and Provinsion IT Infrastructure though code and automation, rather than manual processes or configuration tools.
Here, Code files can be stored in Version Control System (VCS) allowing to easily track changes and collaborate among the team.

IaC enables teams to automate the process of creating, deploying and managing various infrastructure components like networks, compute, storage and etc.

IaC ensures consistency and repetability across different environments (eg. Development, staging and production).

# What is Terraform?
Terraform is an Open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp that allows you to Provision, manage and modify infrastructure resources across various cloud providers, on-premises environments, and third-party services. 

Terraform uses declarative language called HCL to define Infrastructure components in Human-readable format.

Terraform enables users to create and manage infrastructure resources by writing configuration files that describe the desired state of the infrastructure. 
These configuration files are executed by Terraform CLI, which interacts with respective Providerâ€™s APIs and create, update or delete resources as necessary to match the desired state.


# Multi Cloud With Terraform
Multi-Cloud with Terraform refers to practising of using Terraform to manage the infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc simultaneously within one single project for organization. 
This approch offers organizations the flexibility to leverage the best services and features from different cloud providers based on their specific requirements and use cases.

Terraform provider-based architecture makes multi-cloud management possible. Each provider  in terraform is responsible for managing resources within a specific cloud platform or service.

Terraform configurations, you can create and manage resources across various cloud platforms, enabling a consistent and unifies way of provinsing and managing infrastructure resources in a multi-cloud environment.
